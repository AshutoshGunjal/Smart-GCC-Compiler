# Smart GCC Compiler

- Self-Adjusting Smart Interface for Program Development using GCC Compiler

- Using the GCC compiler, this project is designing and implementing a self-adjusting smart graphical interface for creating C++ programmes. 
- Your interface should be built for three types of users: 
  • Inexperienced user learning programming: you will use compiler options, connexion options, execute options and debug options.
  • Average programmer: in addition to the tools used by beginner users, you need to use code creation and code optimisation methods.
  • Professional Developer: Apart from the options traditional programmers use the software tools.

- The SmartGCC gui will have two windows, one displaying the software on which the user is operating and the other displaying the GCC result/output, in addition to all the user's choices.
- As SmartGCC is enabled it prompts the user to pick the type of user and initialises the menus and commands interface for the type of user chosen.
- The gui should also include a menu item called "All Choices" for all user styles, containing all the choices that any user can choose. 
- Upon selecting the correct options, SmartGCC will use the selected options to execute the programme by calling GCC via the appropriate command line and showing the results. 
- Your interface will be self-adjusted in the sense that when a user executes a command/task from the "All Options" menu that is not included in the user style interface, the command will be included within the relevant menus from the time onwards. 
- Thus all the commands that a user has used in the past will finally be available in the correct menus and can be used efficiently. 
- A proof of concept implementation of SmartGCC should also be implemented using GCC in the context.
